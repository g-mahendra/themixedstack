### What is this ?

As you might have noticed from the title that this is a two part blog where
in this second part I will share the steps required in order to
put this blog working. In the fist part,
I have discussed some terminologies and what challenges I faced.
I suggest you to go ahed and watch the Part 1 first so that you can get some insights on how everything works. if you want, you are free to continue to read this part.
The link for PART 1 can be found down bellow.

  name="next-mdx-tailwind-part-1"

## The Setup...!

- ### Some necessary things:

  We have mainly 3 things that we want in order to put all things together.

  - The NextJS mdx blog repo which you can [clone from this link](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-mdx-remote).
  - The [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
  - The [Tailwind Typography](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography)

  - To clone the repo, use the following command. Make sure to change `your-project-name` with the your name of choice.
    ```
    npx create-next-app --example with-mdx-remote your-project-name
    ```
    After creating the repo locally, change the current directory to the project repo using
    ```
    cd your-project-name
    ```

- ### Clean up of repo...

  The repo uses styled jsx which uses style tag inside the React component in order to give us the flexibility of styling. It is a good way to style our blog but it finally comes down to pure css which we have to write. If we have an option to use tailwind then why not just go straight with it?. Thats why we remove every style tag inside every React component we have in order to start fresh and avoid any ambiguity.

- ### Seting up Tailwind...

  Install the tailwind css packages using following command ( you can find all these tailwind commands in the official [install guide for next js](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs) repo )

  ```
  # If you're on Next.js v10 or newer

  yarn add -D tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest
  ```

  or

  ```
  # If you're on Next.js v9 or older

  yarn add -D tailwindcss@npm:@tailwindcss/postcss7-compat postcss@^7 autoprefixer@^9
  ```

  Now that Tailwind is instaled, use

  ```
  npx tailwindcss init -p
  ```

  This will create `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`files inside your project's root directory. Let's not get too concerned about it. What we have to do is just change
  `purge: []`,

  to
  `purge: ["./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}", "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],`

  so that tailwind can remove all the un-necessary styles that take up a lot of space. Don't vorry much about it. May be we can talk abou it in some other post.

- ### Styling the markdown

  Upto the above point, you are good to go with styling your react components as you like using tailwind but as mentioned in part 1, we cannot have markdown stay like that without any styles. Here, the Tailwind Typography comes into picture. It provides some usefull classes that we can pass as `className` to the container which encloses the line where our markdown is rendered. Sounds intimidating ? I know. Let us look at the code so that you can get a clear idea about what I am trying to say.

  ```jsx
  export default function PostPage({ source, frontMatter }) {
    return (
      <Layout>
        <main>
          <MDXRemote {...source} components={components} />
        </main>
      </Layout>
    );
  }
  ```

  look at the above code where `<main>` tag surrounds the `<MDXRemote>` tag. The `<MDXRemote` helps us render the html converted from markdown to our screen.  
  The `main` tag is where we want to add our tailwind typography `prose` classes ( prose is a name given by tailwind to utility classes which help us style markdown. ). After adding prose classes to the code, the code-block should now look like following.

  ```jsx
  export default function PostPage({ source, frontMatter }) {
    return (
      <Layout>
        <main className=" prose lg:prose-xl">
          <MDXRemote {...source} components={components} />
        </main>
      </Layout>
    );
  }
  ```

In order to use the prose styles, we have to do just one more thing.  
Add the following line inside `tailwind.config.js` under plugins array.

```js
require("@tailwindcss/typography");
```

You can explore the directory and find how the post data flows but it does not stop us from getting started and writting our blogs. Each time you want to write a new post, head to the posts directory inside directory and add a file with .mdx extension.  
As we are using mdx and not just the pure markdown, we can embed the react components inside mdx files and customize them as you see fit. Example of such a component is the link to first part that you can see up at the top of this page.

> If you plan to style the blog in dark mode as I have done, check out the [customize guide](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography) of tailwind typography in order to achieve the desired effects.

Thats it. Go ahead and start blogging :)
