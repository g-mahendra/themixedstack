## What is actually NextJS ?

Let's start by knowing what actually is NextJS?.
As you are on this blog post, you might already know what the NextJS is but it is my duty to tell you.
In short <CustomLink to="https://nextjs.org" text="NextJS"/> is a framework for ReactJS created by <CustomLink to="https://vercel.com/dashboard" text="vercel"/> where
this blog is currently hosted. It has some really amazing features such as
**Static Site Generation**, **Server Side rendering**, **Image Optimization** etc.
It helps creating websites way easier while using power of React at your finguretips.

## What is firebase ?

We have seen that NextJS is a really great tool for building web apps but
if you want to use some databases or some backend stuff, you probabaly need to use node js.
This is also fine till some other phenomeno come into picture such as cloud storage, authentication etc.
If you implement your own backend, you need to take into account all these things and trust me, you cannot run away from that.
This is where <CustomLink to="https://firebase.google.com/" text="Firebase"/> shines.  
Google has given us a lot of backend functionality rigt in our hands. What we have to do is just set things up with our
framework of choice and call the predefined functions given by firebase. If you are new to this stuff, don't sweat it.
I will make things simple so that you can get started with NextJS and firebase with a little bit of knowledge.  
This is a series of blog posts where in this first post, we will do a basic setup such as c
reating NextJS app and installing firebase and tailwindcss.
( forgot to mention that you will get to know how to setup NextJS with tailwind.
If you do not want to use tailwind then you can skip the tailwind specific package installation and setup. )  
Enough talking. Let's jump in.

## The basic setup.

> **TL;DR** If you want to type in the commands yourself and have a closer look
> then you can follow along with this post otherwise you can simply clone <CustomLink to="https://github.com/g-mahendra/next-tailwind-template" text="this"/> repository,
> install firebase with `yarn add firebase` or `npm install firebase` and move to the next part using the link at bottom of this page

For this, we will create a basic NextJS app first and then we will do the setup step by step.
We will use `create-next-app` which gives us bare minimum code in order to get started.
We are calling the app as firebase-example. You are free to choose whatever you want.  
So we will open up our terminal and type the following command.

```
$ npx create-next-app firebase-example
```

This will create a basic nextjs starter app with name firebase-example.Now change the current directory to **firebase-example** with

```
$ cd firebase-example
```

Once we are in the directory,
we will install the necessary packages which will be required in order to use tailwindcss and firebase.  
In the terminal, we will type

```
# tailwind specific packages ( optional )

# if using yarn
$ yarn add -D tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest

# if using npm
$ npm install -D tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest
```

followed by

```
# firebase node_module

# if using yarn
$ yarn add firebase

# if using npm
$ npm install firebase
```

This will take care of all the necessary packages for tailwind and firebase.
You don't need more details on what they do as tailwind will take care of all the necessary stuff for us.

Now that all the packages are installed, open up your code editor of choice.
( please do not even think of opening Notepad or Notepad++ ðŸ˜…. Just kidding )
I am using Visual Studio Code. You can use whatever suits you.

I have the command set up so I will type

```
$ code .
```

and this will open up VSCode in my cwd ( current working directory )

## Some tailwind specific setup

We will go over this quickly. You can learn more about this setup <CustomLink to="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs" text="here"/>.

1. First we will start by deleting the styles directory as we will not be using our custom styles. So we will delete the folder highlighted in image shown below.
   ![Image showing directory to be deleted](/images/styles.png)

2. After deleting styles directory, make sure to fix the imports where the styles were imported
   otherwise you are going to see a bag of errors on the screen. Once we are done with it, we need to
   initialize the tailwind configuration so that we can actually use it. For this type the following command inside the terminal.

```
# initialize tailwind command
$ npx tailwindcss init -p
```

3. Now the third task is to add the import statement in our `_app.js` file which makes sure that all tailwind styles are applied throughout our application.
   So add the following line at the top of \_app.js file.

```
 import 'tailwindcss/tailwind.css'
```

4. The one last thing remains is changing the purge array to the following

```
purge: ['./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}', './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'],
```

inside `tailwind.config.js`.
This will make sure that you don't ship the unused css to the client side so that faster builds are ensured.

## Summary

This was a basic setup with nextjs, tailwind and firebase.
Integrating the firebase with nextjs along with tailwind css is one of the most amazing combinations
out there in web development world.
Now you can move to the next part where we will implement firebase authentication and signin and signup forms using tailwind.
